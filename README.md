# Double Entry Bookkeeping API
Implementation of a Double-entry bookkeeping service using Spring 5, Java Transaction API and the H2 database in embedded mode.

Description
--------------------

**Double-entry bookkeeping** involves making at least two entries or legs for every transaction.
A debit in one account and a corresponding credit in another account.
The sum of all debits should always equal the sum of all credits, providing a simple way to check for errors.
The following rules **MUST** apply:

  * An account **MUST NOT** be overdrawn, i.e. have a negative balance.
  * A monetary transaction **MAY** support multiple currencies as long as the total balance for the transaction legs with the same currency is zero.
  * The concepts of debit and credit are simplified by specifying that monetary transactions towards an account can have either a positive or negative value.
